### Methods

#### Gpio(gpio[, options])
- gpio - an unsigned integer specifying the GPIO number
- options - object (optional)

Returns a new Gpio object for accessing a GPIO. The optional options object can
be used to configure the mode, pull type, interrupting edge(s), interrupt
timeout, and alerts for the GPIO.

A Gpio object is an EventEmitter.

GPIOs on Linux are identified by unsigned integers. These are the numbers that
should be passed to the Gpio constructor. For example, pin 7 on the Raspberry
Pi P1 expansion header corresponds to GPIO4 in Raspbian Linux. 4 is therefore
the number to pass to the Gpio constructor when using pin 7 on the P1 expansion
header.

The following options are supported:
- mode - INPUT, OUTPUT, ALT0, ALT1, ALT2, ALT3, ALT4, or ALT5 (optional, no default)
- pullUpDown - PUD_OFF, PUD_DOWN, or PUD_UP (optional, no default)
- edge - interrupt edge for inputs. RISING_EDGE, FALLING_EDGE, or EITHER_EDGE (optional, no default)
- timeout - interrupt timeout in milliseconds (optional, defaults to 0 meaning no timeout if edge specified)
- alert - boolean specifying whether or not alert events are emitted when the GPIO changes state (optional, default false)

If no mode option is specified, the GPIO will be left in it's current mode. If
pullUpDown is not not specified, the pull-type for the GPIO will not be
modified. This makes it possible to implement programs that do things like
print information about the current mode and logic level for all GPIOs, for
example:

```js
const Gpio = require('pigpio').Gpio;

for (let gpioNo = Gpio.MIN_GPIO; gpioNo <= Gpio.MAX_GPIO; gpioNo += 1) {
  const gpio = new Gpio(gpioNo);

  console.log('GPIO ' + gpioNo + ':' +
    ' mode=' + gpio.getMode() +
    ' level=' + gpio.digitalRead()
  );
}
```

If an interrupt edge is specified, the Gpio will emit an 'interrupt' event each
time an interrupt is detected. Interrupt events are low latency events and will
be emitted as quickly as possible. The level argument passed to the interrupt
event listener is the level read at the time the process was informed of the
interrupt. The level may not be the same as the expected edge as interrupts
happening in rapid succession may be missed by the kernel.

Interrupts can have an optional timeout. The level argument passed to the
interrupt event listener will be TIMEOUT (2) if the optional interrupt timeout
expires.

If alerts are enabled, the Gpio will emit an 'alert' event each time the GPIO
state changes. The logic level and time of the state change accurate to a few
microseconds are passed to the alert event listener. GPIOs are sampled at a
rate set when the library is started. The default sample rate is 5 microseconds
but it can be set 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, or 10 microseconds with the
[configureClock](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#configureclockmicroseconds-peripheral)
function. State changes shorter than the sample rate may be missed.
Alert events are emitted nominally 1000 times per second and there will be one
alert event for each state change detected. i.e. There will be alert events for
all state changes but there will be a latency.

#### The Difference Between Interrupts and Alerts

Both interrupts and alerts provide information about state changes. Interrupts
provide this information as quickly as possible and the latency is as low as
possible. Alerts are queued and fired once per millisecond so the latency is
higher. However, alerts also provide `tick` information that's accurate to a
few microseconds. In addition, it's possible to detect more alerts than
interrupts per second.

#### mode(mode)
- mode - INPUT, OUTPUT, ALT0, ALT1, ALT2, ALT3, ALT4, or ALT5

Sets the GPIO mode. Returns this.

#### getMode()
Returns the GPIO mode.

#### pullUpDown(pud)
- pud - PUD_OFF, PUD_DOWN, or PUD_UP

Sets or clears the resistor pull type for the GPIO. Returns this.

#### digitalRead()
Returns the GPIO level, 0 or 1.

#### digitalWrite(level)
- level - 0 or 1

Sets the GPIO level to 0 or 1. If PWM or servo pulses are active on the GPIO
they are switched off. Returns this.

#### trigger(pulseLen, level)
- pulseLen - pulse length in microseconds (1 - 100)
- level - 0 or 1

Sends a trigger pulse to the GPIO. The GPIO is set to level for pulseLen
microseconds and then reset to not level. 

#### pwmWrite(dutyCycle)
- dutyCycle - an unsigned integer >= 0 (off) and <= range (fully on). range defaults to 255.

Starts PWM on the GPIO. Returns this.

Uses DMA to control and schedule the pulse lengths and duty cycles. pwmRange
can be used to change the default range of 255.

#### hardwarePwmWrite(frequency, dutyCycle)
- frequency - an unsigned integer >= 0 and <= 125000000
- dutyCycle - an unsigned integer >= 0 (off) and <= 1000000 (fully on).

Starts hardware PWM on the GPIO at the specified frequency and dutyCycle.
Frequencies above 30MHz are unlikely to work. Returns this.

hardwarePwmWrite can only be invoked if the pigpio main clock is PCM. The main
clock defaults to PCM but can be overridden by invoking the
[configureClock](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#configureclockmicroseconds-peripheral)
function.

The actual number of steps bteween off and fully on is the integral part of 250
million divided by frequency.

The actual frequency set is 250 million / steps. 

There will only be a million steps for a frequency of 250. Lower frequencies
will have more steps and higher frequencies will have fewer steps. duytCycle is
automatically scaled to take this into account.

All models of the Raspberry Pi support hardware PWM on GPIO18.

#### getPwmDutyCycle()
Returns the PWM duty cycle setting on the GPIO.

#### pwmRange(range)
- range - an unsigned integer in the range 25 through 40000

Selects the duty cycle range to be used for the GPIO. Subsequent calls to
pwmWrite will use a duty cycle between 0 (off) and range (fully on).

If PWM is currently active on the GPIO its duty cycle will be scaled to reflect
the new range. 

The real range, the number of steps between fully off and fully on for each
frequency ans sample rate, is given in the following table.

1us | 2us | 4us | 5us | 8us | 10us | Real Range |
---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
40000 | 20000 | 10000 | 8000 | 5000 | 4000 |25 |

The real value set by pwmWrite is (dutyCycle * real range) / range. 

#### getPwmRange()
Returns the duty cycle range used for the GPIO.

If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported range will be 1000000.

#### getPwmRealRange()
Returns the real range used for the GPIO.

If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported real range will be
approximately 250M divided by the set PWM frequency.

#### pwmFrequency(frequency)
- frequency - an unsigned integer >= 0

Sets the frequency in hertz to be used for the GPIO. Returns this.

Each GPIO can be independently set to one of 18 different PWM frequencies. 

The selectable frequencies depend upon the sample rate which may be 1, 2, 4, 5,
8, or 10 microseconds (default 5). The sample rate can be set with the
[configureClock](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#configureclockmicroseconds-peripheral)
function.

If PWM is currently active on the GPIO it will be switched off and then back on
at the new frequency.

The frequencies in hertz for each sample rate are:

1us | 2us | 4us | 5us | 8us | 10us |
---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
40000 | 20000 | 10000 | 8000 | 5000 | 4000 |

100 | 50 | 25 | 20 | 13 | 10 |
50 | 25 | 13 | 10 | 6 | 5 |

#### getPwmFrequency()
Returns the frequency (in hertz) used for the GPIO. The default frequency is
800Hz.

If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported frequency will be that set
by hardwarePwmWrite.

#### servoWrite(pulseWidth)
- pulseWidth - pulse width in microseconds, an unsigned integer, 0 or a number in the range 500 through 2500

Starts servo pulses at 50Hz on the GPIO, 0 (off), 500 (most anti-clockwise) to
2500 (most clockwise). Returns this.

#### getServoPulseWidth()
Returns the servo pulse width setting on the GPIO.

#### enableInterrupt(edge[, timeout])
- edge - RISING_EDGE, FALLING_EDGE, or EITHER_EDGE
- timeout - interrupt timeout in milliseconds (optional, defaults to 0 meaning no timeout)

Enables interrupts for the GPIO. Returns this.

Interrupts can have an optional timeout. The level argument passed to the
interrupt event listener will be TIMEOUT (2) if the optional interrupt timeout
expires.

#### disableInterrupt()
Disables interrupts for the GPIO. Returns this.

#### enableAlert()
Enables alerts for the GPIO. Returns this.

An alert event will be emitted every time the GPIO changes state.

#### disableAlert()
Disables alerts for the GPIO. Returns this.

#### glitchFilter(steady)
Sets a glitch filter on a GPIO. Returns this.
- steady - Time, in microseconds, during which the level must be stable. Maximum value: 300000

Level changes on the GPIO are not reported unless the level has been stable for at least `steady` microseconds. The level is then reported. Level changes of less than `steady` microseconds are ignored. This means that event callbacks will only be executed if the level change is at least `steady` microseconds long. Note that each (stable) edge will be timestamped `steady` microseconds after it was first detected.

This filter only affects the execution of callbacks from the `alert` event, not those of the `interrupt` event.

#### waveAddGeneric(numPulses, pulses)
- numPulses - the number of pulses
- pulses - an array of pulses { gpioOn: int, gpioOff: int, usDelay: int }

### Events

#### Event: 'alert'
- level - the GPIO level when the state change occurred, 0 or 1
- tick - the time stamp of the state change, an unsigned 32 bit integer

tick is the number of microseconds since system boot and it should be accurate
to a few microseconds.

As tick is an unsigned 32 bit quantity it wraps around after 2^32 microseconds,
which is approximately 1 hour 12 minutes. 

It's not necessary to worry about wrap around when subtracting one tick from
another tick if the JavaScript sign propagating right shift operator `>>` is used.

For example, the following code which simply subtracts `startTick` from `endTick`
prints -4294967294 which isn't the difference we're looking for:

```js
const startTick = 0xffffffff; // 2^32-1 or 4294967295, the max unsigned 32 bit integer
const endTick = 1;
console.log(endTick - startTick); // prints -4294967294 which isn't what we want
```

However, the following code which right shifts both `startTick` and `endTick` 0
bits to the right before subtracting prints 2 which is the difference we're
looking for:

```js
const startTick = 0xffffffff; // 2^32-1 or 4294967295, the max unsigned 32 bit integer
const endTick = 1;
console.log((endTick >> 0) - (startTick >> 0)); // prints 2 which is what we want
```

#### Event: 'interrupt'
- level - the GPIO level when the interrupt occurred, 0, 1, or TIMEOUT (2)

Emitted on interrupts.

Interrupts can have an optional timeout. The level argument passed to the
interrupt event listener will be TIMEOUT (2) if the optional interrupt timeout
expires.
